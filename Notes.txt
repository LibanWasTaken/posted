********

Add a scoring system:

the longer the post takes to release, the more points it gets

it can be a subtle thing: 
color (invert, or use colors)
maybe the post cards? like a loading bar. in respect to the post with the LARGEST period? 

also a way to sort them - shortest time period to longest
search them with specific periods - like age of 1 yr or 1 month

if prem/or not, add a post type feature:

could be a small badge in corner, skull = dead, diary = book emoji, maybe it can be a rounded img iwth a circular background which can represent the scoring system, like a pie chart or color
